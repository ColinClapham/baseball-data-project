Retrosheet is a site which hosts a variety of baseball data points, most relevant of which for this analysis is pitch level data

Yearly zip files are stored on the site which can be downloaded locally and processed with the job 'extract-pitch-data'
(*Note*-  until March 26, 2024, data was able to be extracted programmatically; the retrosheet site updated their SSL certification which seems to make this impossible now)
